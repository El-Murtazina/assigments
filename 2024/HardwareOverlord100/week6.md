# Hardware Team Report

## Presentation: 

We prepared the presentation in the way that we see the most efficient
to tell the story of our product. It includes:

-   Our project description and it's validity

-   Information about our team members

-   The list of overall steps

-   Simplified breakage of every step

-   Final result of the project + IRL demonstration (3-4 minutes)

-   Future steps on improvement

-   Final words

We formulated the slides in the language that we think will be most
effective to reach the main audience. Also the speech on the final
presentation won't contain the content from the slides, as people will
give speeches prepared in advance.

Our team understands the importance of the visual content of the
presentation. That's why we will include relevant photo and video
materials to the slides. Also we plan on adding the showcase video which
will be played as our team gives the demonstration on the final product.
At the end of the presentation we will include a QR-code to the Figma
page with all of the information relevant to the project, including
contact of the team, calculations, graphs etc. We hope that this measure
will help our possible clients to keep interested in our project.

## Weekly Progress Report: 

For the 6th week our team did the assembly of the robot. All of the
parts we ordered now arrived and assembled on the frame. Also this week
we presented solutions for different mechanisms that potential customers
stated they are looking for from previous feedback collections and
questionnaires.

### Challenges & Solutions 

Our team faced a problem with setting up Nvidia Xavier which led to its
failed connection to the motor drivers. This problem was resolved and
tests confirmed that these parts work together properly.

### Conclusions & Next Steps 

Next steps are the final steps of our journey, they include:

-   Making sure that robot is assembled properly

-   Running tests on assembled robot

-   Connect hardware with the software solution and run test

-   Finish the aluminum shell of the robot and give it a final look
